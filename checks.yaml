# In this file you can define checks list.
# Each entry is small dictionary with name of check (it will be used to post status to MR/PR)
# and shell command to be executed as a check. If exit code of command is non-zero, then check will fail.

# By default this file should be placed in root of repository.
# This behaviour can be changed in Jenkinsfile file.

# Example checks list:
checks:
  - name: "Test check"
    command: "echo test"
  - name: "List env"
    command: "env"
